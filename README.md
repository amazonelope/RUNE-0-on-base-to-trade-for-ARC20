# RUNE:0-on-base-to-trade-for-atomicals ARC20 RUNE
RUNE:0 on base is a way for people on base to mint or buy rune:0 coins in order to trade for rune on ARC20
The exchange is currently being finalized by special dev team with 6 yeasr experience with goal for 75% smart contract integration by 4/15/24 and 100% smart contract integration by the halvening. or 4/20/24. whichever comes first.
AMM code integrated with aerodrome on base, router, deentralized swap protocal, clone, end points, call response simple work through, easy transparent basic UI. mint deploy send, both on chain and off chain. 12 hour lockup period for the ai, guaranteed monetary volitle but protocal-stable liquidity, indexed through private funnels, segwit, deep allowance of 3 zksnark.
We are on telegram and discord (invite only) and will be releasing a large open forum and a second and third hack a thon to test the security, and a group message on twitter X on spaces.
We are fans of Jack Levine VMPX and we see great inherent value in a token standard that is swappable, recognizable and that exists on all three major chains, (EVM- through base, ordinals through PIPE and their own rune standard being released at the halvening. 
Tokenomics depends on the timing and approval of aerodrome before the halvening and we guarantee at least 8,000 RUNE and at most 58,000 Rune depending on liquidity and market forces. We also guanatee protocal stability and rigorous stress testing and as long as ordinals rune and EVM stay online, we should have no trouble.
Marketing is through aerodrome with incentivized staking to enhance fair and liquid distribution in a fair and decentralized manner.
Stability enhanced by diversified assetts: Baseswap exchange and aerodrome on base and on atomicals we have rune and other ARC20s and on ordials we have moon BRC20 and pipe RUNE:0, 
We are a small deentralized immutable team that has been working on this for months, it is now time to shine!
